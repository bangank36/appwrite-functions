# Appwrite functions 
My personal experiement with Appwrite functions

# Local development
- Inspired by https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/issues/5425
- Steps:
   1. `cd functions/starter-function`
   2. `npm run dev`: for running the local-server.js file for testing the function in /src/main.js
